## Installation

For installation, 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Download Pretrained Classifier Weights
Download and extract weights to project root
> üì• Weights Source: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rbky25u6A_96MtKEs4Pzu_M2HvBci7Y?usp=sharing)

### 2. Execution Pipeline
RecDreamer follows a 3-stage generation workflow similar to ProlificDreamer:

```bash
# Stage 1: Initial Optimization
bash scripts/exp_stage1.sh <cuda-device-id>

# Stage 2: Geometric Refinement
bash scripts/exp_stage2.sh <cuda-device-id>

# Stage 3: Final Rendering
bash scripts/exp_stage3.sh <cuda-device-id>
```
> üîß Replace `<cuda-device-id>` with your GPU index (e.g., `0` for the first GPU).


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management

### Instance Specification
The instances are defined in the file `classifier_configs.json`. Specify the instance for optimization in the file `scripts/exp_stage1.sh` (Line 18).



## üõ† Development Status
**Active Development Roadmap**:
‚Ä¢ üõ† Additional feature implementation in progress
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Targeted patch release by April 26th (bug fixes & stability improvements)




First, download the classifier weights from the [source](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rbky25u6A_96MtKEs4Pzu_M2HvBwci7Y?usp=sharing) and unzip it into the current folder.

<!-- **Limitations:** (1) Our work takes extra time for optimization. -->

## TODO List
- [x] Release RecDreamer for 3D.
- [ ] Release RecDreamer for 2D.
- [ ] Custom classifier for orientation.
- [ ] Custom classifier with Zero-123.
